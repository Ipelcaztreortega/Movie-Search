# Movie Search Application Challenge


## Task

Create a simple movie search application using React and the OMDb API.


## Brief Explanation of My Code

Using React + Vite + TypeScript, I created a small frontend application that will have the user search in a movie, then the results will be show in a pagination manner. Once you find the result you are interested in, the user is allowed to click on the movie card and go into further detail as they are taken into a different page. 


**Decisions Made During Development:** 
- Deciding on using JavaScript or TypeScript, because I am much more experience in JavaScript, but decided that this is a great way to work on using TypeScript.

- Deciding on using React or React Vite. Since this was a smaller project, I used React Vite because of the smoother experience. 

## Set Up Instructions & Getting Started

1. The project was made using [React Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

2. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the GitHub repository page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

3. Clone the repository from your repository to your local machine in your terminal
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

4. Install dependencies in your terminal
    ```bash
    npm install dotenv react-router-dom --save-dev @types/node

5. Second, go into your .env file and fill in the information for your api key given to you from the [OMDb API - The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/). You might have to sign up if you do not have one.


## How to Run Application

1. Once you followed the instructions above, go into the terminal and run these commands:
    ```bash
    cd MTH
    npm install
    npm run dev

2. In order to exit, follow this command in your terminal
    ```bash
    control + C
